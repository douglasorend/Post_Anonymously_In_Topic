[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod adds a permission-based ability to post anonymously within topics to your forum.  The poster retains the ability to edit the post, and can see his/her own posts like normal.  Other posters can't see which member posted.

Admins and membergroups with the appropriate permission granted can also view who posted what anonymously, assuming that the posting setting is set to [b]"See Who Posted Anonymously" permission permitted[/b]....  Admin who don't want this feature active can disable it by going into the [b]Post Settings[/b] page and change the [b]Who Can See Anonymous Poster[/b] setting.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Admin Settings[/u][/size][/b][/color]
There are two new permissions added in the Admin Area:
o [b]Post Anonymously[/b]
o [b]See Who Posted Anonymously[/b]

There is also a new setting in the [b]Admin[/b] -> [b]Forum[/b] -> [b]Posts and Topics[/b] -> [b]Post Settings[/b] area, called [b]Who Can See Anonymous Poster[/b].  It can be set to one of 4 settings:
o [b]No One.  Also disables recording Member ID[/b]
o [b]No One[/b]
o [b]Only Original Poster (OP)[/b]
o [b]Everyone with "See Who Posted Anonymously" permission[/b]

All setting options disable the "See Who Posted Anonymously" permission except for the last option.  The default setting for the mod is [b]Everyone with "See Who Posted Anonymously" permission[/b].
