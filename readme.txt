[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod adds a permission-based membergroup ability to post anonymously within topics to your forum.  Members with the [b]Post Anonymously[/b] permission can post in boards that allow anonymous posting.

The [b]Who Can See Anonymous Poster[/b] setting controls what can be seen:
o [b]No One.  Also disables recording Member ID[/b] - No one will ever know who made the post!  Ninja mode!
o [b]No One[/b] - The member who posted anonymously is recorded, but no one will ever know!
o [b]Only Original Poster (OP)[/b] - Only the member posting anonymously can see his/her anonymous posts.
o [b]Everyone with "See Who Posted Anonymously" permission[/b] - OP plus membergroups with [b]Who Can See Anonymous Poster[/b] permission can see anonymous posts.

Admins and membergroups with the appropriate permission granted can also view who posted what anonymously, assuming that the posting setting is set to [b]"See Who Posted Anonymously" permission permitted[/b]....  Admin who don't want this feature active can disable it by going into the [b]Post Settings[/b] page and change the [b]Who Can See Anonymous Poster[/b] setting.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Admin Settings[/u][/size][/b][/color]
There is a new setting under [b]Admin[/b] -> [b]Forum[/b] -> [b]Boards[/b] -> [b]Modify[/b] called [b]Able to post anonymously in this board?[/b], which controls whether membergroups can post anonymously in that board.

There are two new membergroup permissions added in the Admin Area:
o [b]Post Anonymously[/b]
o [b]See Who Posted Anonymously[/b]

The [b]Who Can See Anonymous Poster[/b] is under [b]Admin[/b] -> [b]Forum[/b] -> [b]Posts and Topics[/b] -> [b]Post Settings[/b] area.  The settings are described under [b]Introduction[/b].  All setting options disable the "See Who Posted Anonymously" permission except for the last option.  The default setting for the mod is [b]Everyone with "See Who Posted Anonymously" permission[/b].
